### [Copy heading link](https://www.marta-puerto.com/\#h.yqx1go862pze)    Community building (Slack)

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/mGo7G9rOo9PP0m2so7d-LEpF9yMpYXXdC-PClEDrhQvRPEfN6_uxC0cDXzGmUjd6u3YScR8A8GqZ-rxuA3sUlv5jDRZQt3ygortZzl_jbs0c9_Z6ZdodYglCRmmEPR928g=w1280)

Context:More and more brands are jumping into forums, to meet where their target audience is, listen to them and create a conversation with their customers.

Action: I built the first [community of freelancers in Spain](https://www.xolo.io/es-es/community) from scratch, as a brand initiative for Xolo. A Slack space where to ask questions, share resources, find job opportunities and connect with fellow fiercely independent professionals.

Results:

- Launch: 200 active users the first week, 50 users messaging daily

- 700+ users in the community with a growth rate of 10% every quarter

- Over 100 active users a week

- More than 11K messages sent

### [Copy heading link](https://www.marta-puerto.com/\#h.2o49gbk25qc)    Online Reputation Management

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/qEURY17eZoKhB4hDhri_CAimgWG-pvMKMa96PMzTelTbvOUEQRhGttb-4c7EpbYnOGTDVfUN9bhlTcL5KsqSN3cbeYyHGFAGLg6LlpgP9mM2snV5B8H0NN290nZABZACpg=w1280)

Context: Our online reputation needed to be improved in order to attract more customers. Our goal was to get 50 new reviews and end up with an average of 4.5 stars or more in our review sites.

Action:

- Shared links to leave reviews at the end of every good customer support call.

- Created a workflow of action triggered emails and in-app notification asking for a review. For example after our accountants filed their tax returns.

- Email campaign with an incentive: ‚Äúleave a review for the chance to win a month for free‚Äù

- Responded to all our reviews to show that our customers' opinion matters

- Created a [blog article](https://blog.xolo.io/es/xolo-opiniones) for branded keywords once we reached our best score to control the narrative around our brand reputation.


Results:

- 160+ reviews on Google in Spain and 40+ reviews in Spanish. Exceeded the goal before the end of the quarter.

- Increased the review score by 5 points. Google from 4.0 to 4.5 and TrustPilot from 3.7 to 4.2.


### [Copy heading link](https://www.marta-puerto.com/\#h.qs648ts5d61d)    Product explainer video

[![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/1lEzXhtoU6yJzrm3t1GWgRIhPVbEGW0x6Wwofe4KNKqrTNILIHb8fUYpjoJl_zZORT4bPs6ejqSrPcMIzRUGg5XMDnhdgXc-QxbYH3Uqa1WFrkyCOyKtEFyJF9yBbsRKCaZEhBTxy9ujWy7M5QJDF0JSZwRw7DvKdwKTnnsVtevPzfFBeBNkds8HtQ)Xolo GestoriÃÅa Explainer Video](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F906837174%2F11d5315f75&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1_NTXy5vQ3LTpWhHeCuRh0)

Context: Existing homepage visitors didn‚Äôt get a quick and clear overview of what the product looked like or what it could do for them. This was stopping them from considering us/converting.

Action: I lead the creation of a 30-60 sec long product explainer video that would be later embedded [on the website](https://www.xolo.io/es-es) to provide a quick and engaging overview of what they can achieve with Xolo and increase consideration/conversion. The project involved:

- Creating a script adapting product messaging (in-house copywriter)

- Storyboard (in-house design team)

- Hiring a motion graphics designer

- Hiring a voiceover artist

- Creating mockups for the video on website

- Implementing on website (in-house FE developer)

- Developing a distribution plan


Results:20% lift in the New User to Sign Up conversion rate. Video used as a sales enablement material.

### [Copy heading link](https://www.marta-puerto.com/\#h.i2gyruqhm6zu)    Lead generation campaign

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/nQO5hjO_nfpyT-mGIv-EzexL2HUDzq8Y5yZeiOfFESF6eG3D1vjhDc_qAAMF6Qy4D962gjiK93C1Plv45-2tvQsw6iBibZh6vKUNGMRVLok7g6ty7BN1-t9U7RjZg4ouHw=w1280)

Context:End of the year was approaching and in 2023 there was a change in the Spanish legislation regarding self-employed business set up which was creating a lot of confusion amongst freelancers. We didn't want to miss the opportunity to do something so by educating our audience in the matter, we wanted to position our brand as the authority in the industry and also attract them to be our customers.

Action: Playing with the urgency factor we created a conversion focused [landing page](https://lp.xolo.io/alta-antes-2023) to generate leads, which we amplified via paid channels: LinkedIn, Meta, Google Search and Google Display. We then nurtured those leads through the funnel into conversion with an email workflow. As an extension of this we also created a webinar and an email campaign targeted to all our users.

Results: This campaign contributed to a 20% increase on new Sign ups. As a result, in the beginning of 2023 a lead generation-focused downloadable guide on the same topic and a bunch of SEO blog articles which contributed to the strengthening of our brand authority.

### [Copy heading link](https://www.marta-puerto.com/\#h.yuxepgl3tvyd)    Customer Success stories

Context: Social proof is one of the most important aspects to build brand trust and credibility, since people are more and more skeptical in their purchase decisions.

Action: Creating a series of [customer stories](https://blog.xolo.io/es/tag/historias) to contribute to Xolo‚Äôs brand reputation, boost sales, build trust with prospects and increase customer loyalty.

- Identifying and emailing loyal customers

- Coordination with the candidates

- Interview questions

- Editing and writing the stories

- Creating a new blog section for those stories

- Included them in email workflows, shared on social media and Slack community, published it on the company‚Äôs website


Results:

- Increased trust in the Xolo brand

- Other customers wanting to be featured in our blog
